OpenCL Setup and Implementation for DETI Coin Search
OpenCL Basics

OpenCL allows parallel computation on heterogeneous devices, like GPUs or multi-core CPUs, and can accelerate workloads significantly.
You'll need an OpenCL runtime installed and a device (either CPU or GPU) to run your code on.
Steps for Integrating OpenCL into the DETI Coin Search:

Step 1: Initialize OpenCL

You need to set up the OpenCL platform, select the device (CPU/GPU), and create a context and queue.
Use clGetPlatformIDs, clGetDeviceIDs, and other OpenCL API functions to gather the available platforms and devices.
Step 2: Write the OpenCL Kernel

The kernel will contain the logic to calculate the MD5 hash of each coin, and the number of trailing zeros in the hash.
OpenCL kernels are written in C-like language and are compiled and executed on the OpenCL device.
Step 3: Memory Management

Allocate buffers for storing the coins and hashes on both the host (CPU) and device (GPU).
Transfer the input coins to the device memory, and after the kernel execution, retrieve the results.
Step 4: Execute the Kernel

Launch the OpenCL kernel on the device and handle synchronization.
Step 5: Handle Results

Check the computed hashes and count the trailing zero bits to determine if a coin is valid.
Store and report valid coins as necessary.


Files Needed
deti_coins_opencl_search.c

This file will be the main implementation for the DETI coins search using OpenCL. It will handle OpenCL initialization, kernel loading, and executing the search process on the GPU.
It includes the OpenCL kernel code (MD5 search kernel) and manages memory buffers and transfers.
Content:
OpenCL setup (initialize_opencl())
OpenCL kernel execution (deti_coins_opencl_search())
A main() function to initiate the search process.
OpenCL kernel source code embedded (or loaded from a file).
deti_coins_opencl_kernel.cl (optional, if you want to load the kernel from a file)

This file contains the OpenCL kernel code for the MD5 search process. You can define the OpenCL kernel here separately, or you can embed it in your C file (as shown in the previous response).
Content:
The OpenCL code for the MD5 search algorithm (or your custom search logic).
For example, a kernel function to perform the MD5 hash for each word.
md5.h (if using MD5)

The header file for the MD5 hashing functions. It should declare the function(s) needed to compute MD5 hashes.
Content:
Declarations of the MD5 hashing function(s) like md5_hash().
md5.c (or similar, if you're using MD5 directly)

The implementation file for the MD5 hashing algorithm.
Content:
The implementation of the md5_hash() function or similar logic for performing MD5 on input data.
deti_coins.c

The main driver file that will handle the command-line interface (CLI), initializing and running the program.
Content:
Include deti_coins_opencl_search.c and make sure the program can invoke OpenCL-based search.
Set up the program to allow running the DETI coin search with different methods (-s for CPU, -so for OpenCL).
Makefile or build script

A file to compile your project, linking against OpenCL libraries and the other files youâ€™ve created.
Content:
Instructions to compile all .c files and link them with OpenCL libraries (-lOpenCL).
